                  <h3>Vedic reasons behind Garbh Sanskar
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                     You can invite divine souls to take birth as transition phase is going on. Spiritually during this time all the divine souls are keen to take birth. Divine souls come with good learning to perform good acts in this world. Hence are constantly looking for the right parents, perfect environment where they are groomed in such a manner so that they can continue with their noble work which may be purpose of re-birth. Therefore, the couple has to increase the good karmic level to such an extent that the divine soul chooses it to be its parents. Since all this is possible only during the pregnancy phase which we strongly believe is one of the most important, precious and delicate phase in the lifetime of any mother. People who follow our most advanced Garbh Sanskar antenatal classes sincerely get desirable results.

                     What is Panchakarma Treatment?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                     Panchakarma is a treatment program for the body, mind, and consciousness that cleanses and rejuvenates. It is based on Ayurvedic principles, every human is a unique phenomenon manifested through the five basic elements of Ether, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth.
                     <br>
                     The combination of these elements are three doshas (tridosha): Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, and their balance is unique to each individual. When this doshic balance is disturbed it creates disorder resulting in disease.
                     <br>
                     Panchakarma is done individually for each person with their specific constitution and specific disorder in mind, thus it requires close observation and supervision. Treatment starts with pre-purification Measures of Snehan and Svedana, and then cleansing methods – Shodanas, are applied.

                        Every individual constitution has its own unique balance of vata, pitta, and kapha (VPK) according to its own nature. This balance of VPK is the natural order. When this doshic balance is disturbed, it creates imbalance, which is disorder.
                        <br>
                        Health is order; disease is disorder. Within the body there is a constant interaction between order and disorder, thus once one understands the nature and structure of disorder, one can re-establish order. Ayurveda believes that order lies within disorder. Order is the state of health, as defined by Ayurveda Panchakarma.
                        <br>
                        This exists when the digestive fire (agni) is in a balanced condition; the bodily humors (vata, pitta, and kapha) are in equilibrium, the three waste products (urine, feces, and sweat) are produced and eliminated normally, the seven bodily tissues (rasa, rakta, mamsa, meda, asthi, majja and shukra/artava) are functioning normally, and the mind, senses, and consciousness are working harmoniously together.
                        <br>
                        When the balance of these systems is disturbed, the disease (disorder) process begins.

                  <p>
                     * Yoga is an ancient practice originating from India that encompasses physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines. In Ayurveda, yoga is considered a vital component of a holistic approach to health.<br>
                     * Yoga postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation are fundamental aspects of Ayurvedic practice.
                     The practice of yoga is believed to balance the doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha), improve circulation, enhance digestion, strengthen the immune system, and promote mental clarity and emotional balance.<br>
                     * Different yoga poses and sequences are recommended based on an individual's unique constitution and imbalances. For example, calming and grounding poses may be suggested for someone with excess Vata, while cooling and soothing poses may be recommended for individuals with excess Pitta.
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                     Pregnancy Yoga
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                     * Pregnancy yoga is a gentle form of yoga tailored specifically for pregnant women. It typically focuses on poses and breathing techniques that help alleviate discomfort, reduce stress, and prepare the body for childbirth. It's important to practice under the guidance of a qualified instructor who understands the specific needs and limitations of pregnant women.
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                     Physical Activity
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                     * In Ayurveda, physical activity is seen as essential for maintaining good health and preventing disease. However, the type and intensity of physical activity recommended can vary based on an individual's constitution (Prakriti), current imbalances (Vikriti), age, season, and other factors.<br>
                     * Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of moderation in physical activity. Overexertion or excessive exercise can lead to imbalances in the doshas and may cause harm rather than benefit.<br>
                     * Activities such as walking, swimming, cycling, and gentle forms of exercise are often recommended as they promote circulation, strengthen the body, and help clear ama (toxins) from the system.<br>
                     * Ayurveda also recognizes the importance of adapting physical activity to align with the rhythms of nature and the individual's energy levels. For example, vigorous exercise may be more suitable during the Kapha season (spring), while gentler activities may be preferable during the hot Pitta season (summer).<br>
                     * In Ayurveda, both yoga and physical activity are considered integral components of a healthy lifestyle. When practiced mindfully and in accordance with one's unique constitution and needs, they can contribute to overall well-being, balance, and harmony of the body, mind, and spirit.<br>

                  <h2>Ayurvedic Hair care</h2>
                  <p>Hair is a component of the integumentary system and extends downward into the dermal layer, where it sits in the hair follicle. Humans have approximately five million hair follicles, which offer protection from cold and UV radiation, produce sebum, and can have a significant psychological impact when growth or structure is unbalanced.
                     
                  <p>At a microscopic level, each hair's variety in length, color, diameter, and cross-sectional shape creates the characteristic profiles seen across ethnic groups and among individuals.</p>

like Greying of Hair, Hair Fall, Dryness of Hair , Danduruff, Alopecia, etc.</h3>
               </p>

               <h2>Ayurvedic Skin care</h2>
               <p>Did you know that the skin is the human body's largest external organ? It is also the organ that grows the fastest.</p>
               <p>It covers the body's entire external surface. It is made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis, all three of which vary significantly in their anatomy and function. The skin's structure is made up of an intricate network which serves as the body's initial barrier against pathogens, UV light, and chemicals, and mechanical injury. It also regulates temperature and the amount of water released into the environment.</p>
               <p>Staying and looking young has been desired from time immemorial. Ayurveda is a great combination of art and science for natural beauty. The ancient medicinal discipline of Ayurveda contains several anti-aging secrets. It is a way of life that inspires us to live a healthy lifestyle. Ayurvedic skincare is unlike any other type of beauty treatment. In Ayurveda, it is all about inner wellness, which will subsequently reflect a healthy glow on your skin. Even now, this 5000-year-old kind of medicine works and is the finest cure for most ailments on the planet. It provides a safe and long-lasting anti-aging and skin care treatment, opening up new horizons of beauty, health, and wellness.</p>
               <p>While there may be more reasons, Let's see the factors affecting Skin and Hair.</p>
               <p>Most beauty advice focuses on providing you with hacks that offer immediate solutions to your problems. However, if you concentrate on the characteristics stated below, you will actually feel gorgeous.</p>
               <h3>Stress</h3>
               <p>
                  Stress is the primary cause of serious hormonal imbalances within your body. It also has an effect on your skin by causing damage to the skin’s barrier function, reducing its capacity to absorb and retain moisture. This dehydrated skin appears dry, spotty, and flaking over time. Stress is related to the equilibrium of the three doshas in Ayurveda namely Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Incorporating exercise into your daily routine is the simplest method to combat stress. Going for a stroll and practising yoga and meditation every day will help you manage your stress.
               </p>
               <h3>Sleep</h3>
               <p>
                  Sleep deprivation at night makes you sleepy and tired the next day. It also causes your skin to contend with the lack of sleep, which causes the brightness to fade. Under-eye bags, drooping skin, and dark circles all appear. According to Ayurveda, sleeping 7 to 8 hours a day is insufficient; one must also sleep at the appropriate time.
               </p>
               <h3>
                  Nutritional Deficiency
               </h3>
               <p>“Food is medicine when consumed properly,” says Ayurveda. How healthy you feel is determined by what you eat. Make sure you eat meals high in vitamins and minerals to keep your gut healthy and your skin shining. Add colourful fruits and veggies to your diet to detoxify your skin and achieve supple, acne-free skin.
               </p>
               <h3>Adverse Environment factors</h3>
               <p>Different sorts of pollution have different effects on our bodies and skin. Chemicals such as tar and oil, for example, can clog our pores and create acne or folliculitis, whereas other compounds can induce fluid build-up in the skin and tissue breakdown. They can also cause bacterial infections, hair loss, and skin discoloration. Extreme weather conditions can potentially harm your health and skin if you are not careful.
